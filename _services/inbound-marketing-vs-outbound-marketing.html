        <h3>What is Outbound Marketing?</h3>

            <li>TV / Radio Spots</li>
            <li>Google Ads</li>
          </ul>

        <p>With a outbound marketing campaign such as Google Ads, the number of leads you generate usually stays around the same, as long as you do not change your monthly budget. However, with the same investment, an inbound marketing campaign will continuously help you <b>attract more traffic</b> because the content that you create does not go away. <b>Your content becomes an asset.</b>

        <canvas id="trafficgrowth" width="890" height="300"></canvas>

        <h4>Outbound Marketing</h4>

        <p>The Google Ads campaign attracts around 30 leads per month, with an average cost of 33 USD per lead. Unless you increase your budget, the number of leads remains steady or falls.</p>

          </strong>
        </p>

        <h4>Inbound Marketing</h4>

        <p>The inbound marketing campaign starts off with only 10 leads per Month, with an average cost of ~ 100 USD per Lead. However, since your content doesn't go away, it will continue to attract leads. That means, over the course of the year, the number of leads you acquire increases steadily while the cost per lead falls to a minimum. By December, we are only paying 11 USD per inbound marketing lead.</p>

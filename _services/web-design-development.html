        <h2>Attract and Convert More Qualified Leads with a Website Redesign</h2>

          <p>Your website is the heart of your company’s online marketing efforts. Often the first stop in the buyer’s journey, your website must be well-designed, easy-to-navigate and mobile friendly. In addition, it must speak to potential buyers at every stage of the buyer journey.</p>

These devices vary greatly in size and screen-resolution, requiring a custom-fit mobile site to display everything correctly.</p>

              <p>Responsive design will provide a standard layout that will be visible when you access the website through a desktop, while simultaneously
              creating a mobile layout similar in look and feel, accessed through mobile phones and tablets.</p>

            <h2>Show up on Google</h2>

            <p>In the history of search engine optimization, the rank of a piece of content in search engine results has typically come down to two key drivers: relevancy and authority built through content on your website. When optimizing your content, we focus your copy on specific keywords that match what people are searching for online.</p>

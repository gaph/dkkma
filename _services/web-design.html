  <h3 id="responsive">Responsive Web Design</h3>

    <div class="columns-2">

      <p>A growing number of users use mobile phones and tablets to access the internet. These devices vary greatly in size and screen-resolution, requiring a custom-fit mobile site to display everything correctly.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately it is often too expensive and time intensive to maintain two different websites and automatic conversion tools and plugins do not offer the desired quality. The solution to this problem is simple: Create a website that flexibly adapts to each device automatically. This is known as responsive design.</p>

      <p>A modern website will automatically take care of tasks that were redundant and time intensive in the past. Responsive design will provide a standard layout that will be visible when you access the website through a desktop, while simultaneously creating a mobile layout similar in look and feel, accessed through mobile phones and tablets.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we make use of standards such as HTML5 to guarantee that even videos and media content will run flawlessly on mobile devices.</p>

      <h3 id="static">Static Site <small>ideal for small to medium sites, low overhead, based on Jekyll</small></h3>

      <h4>Why Static</h4
      <p>A static website usually only consists of a few pages with content that do not change very often.  These sites have lower once-off cost to develop than dynamic sites, but if you need to make changes often, it could be advisable to rather go for a dynamic site, as costs are associated every time your developer needs to make changes to a static web page.</p>

      <h4>Jekyll</h4>
      <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.</p>

      <h4>How does it compare?</h4>

      <h5>PRO static</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Crazy fast: No PHP, no MYSQL, can be hosted on a CDN</li>
        <li>Crazy secure: No PHP, no MYSQL, no backend - nothing to hack</li>
        <li>Low overhead: No PHP, no MYSQL, the browser only needs to download and render the website</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>CONTRA static</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>No dynamic content: The site is pre-generated so there's no dynamic content</li>
        <li>No backend: It's not as easy to make changes. Basic HTML knowledge is required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="oscms">Basic CMS <small>ideal for small to medium sites, with backend</small></h3>
      <p>A content management system (CMS) is a software that allows publishing, editing and modifying content without HTML knowledge. The core function and use of content management systems is to store and organize files, provide version-controlled access and enable dynamic elements.</p>

###Problem

```A PHP Error was encountered
Severity: 8192
Message: Non-static method Mx_calc::usage() should not be called statically, assuming $this from incompatible context
Filename: mx_calc/pi.mx_calc.php
Line Number: 20
```

```A PHP Error was encountered
Severity: Warning
Message: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at PATH/system/codeigniter/system/core/Exceptions.php:170)
Filename: core/Common.php
Line Number: 479
```

###Solution

In this case, we need to modify Mx_calc, as stated in the error message:

1. Go to /system/expressionengine/third_party/mx_calc/pi.mx_calc.php
2. Look for **function usage()** around line 61
3. Replace it with **public static function usage()**

####Before

```function usage()
{
ob_start();
?>
```

####After

```public static function usage()
{
ob_start();
?>
```

Here's what you need to do:

```http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=yourdomain.com
https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=yourdomain.com
#replace yourdomain.com
```

This is how you use it:

```<img src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=dkkma.com" alt="DKKMA Agency">
```

Finally, this is how it looks like: <img src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=dkkma.com" alt="DKKMA Agency">

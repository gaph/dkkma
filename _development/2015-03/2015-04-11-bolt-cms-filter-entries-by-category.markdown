Bolt CMS makes it easy to filter entries by category. Here's how:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/franzos/13a7eb4ec60990c00447.js"></script>

Let's have a closer look at the individual elements and what they so.

- **blog** # is where you're getting the entries from (contenttypes.yml)
- **latest** # well, yeah. We want the latest entries!
- **10** # number of entries you'd like to show, assuming you have that many
- **where** # serves as a condition
- **entry_categories** # the group of categories we're pulling from (taxonomy.yml)
- **Development** # FINALLY set the category you'd like to show

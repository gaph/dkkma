<p>This privacy policy explains how DKKMA (referred to as
  <strong>"we"</strong> and
  <strong>"us"</strong> in this policy) may collect and use personal information from you when you use our website (<a href="http://www.dkkma.com/">www.dkkma.com</a>).</p>

<p>As a business, we are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of all individuals with whom we interact. We will process your personal information at all times in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Personal information we collect on this website</strong>
</p>

<p>We collect information about you if you make use of any of the interactive features within our website that rely on a personalised response, or where you ask us to respond to a query you have, or add your details to one of our alert services. The information
  we collect is limited to the details we need to provide the specific service you have asked for.</p>

<p>
  <strong>How we use this information</strong>
</p>

<p>Except where required by law, we only use the personal information you provide to us to deliver the specific information or service you have requested. For example, if you have requested further information on our regulatory news, or wish to subscribe
  to our alert service, we will only use the email address you provide to us to respond to that request. Without your express consent, we will not use your contact details for any other purpose.</p>

<p>
  <strong>How we store your personal information</strong>
</p>

<p>We are committed to ensuring your personal information is kept secure and confidential and not kept for longer than is necessary. From time to time we may ask other members of our group, or third party service providers, to help us manage our information
  technology systems. Some of these systems may be located in countries overseas. We will only transfer your information to a third party service provider or overseas, where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect the
  integrity and security of any information being processed and compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.</p>

<p>
  <strong>How we deploy &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;</strong>
</p>

<p>Cookies are small packets of information stored by your web browser when you visit certain websites, including our website. Cookies are generally used by websites to improve your user experience by enabling that website to &lsquo;remember&rsquo; you,
  either strictly for the duration of your visit (using a &ldquo;Session&rdquo; cookie which is erased when you close your browser) or for repeat visits (using a &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; cookie).</p>

<p>
  <em>
    <strong>By using this website you consent to us deploying cookies as described below. If you do not wish to accept cookies from our site, or would like to stop permanent cookies being stored on your computer in the future you can change the settings in your
      web browser to decline and / or delete cookies. See the "Help" section on your browser menu for guidance on how to do this. Note that changing cookie settings may affect certain features within this website.</strong>

</p>

<p>We deploy cookies to help us to identify how users navigate to and around our website and to enable some of the features within the site that may be beneficial to you (for example, language preferences, or print page features). This helps us deliver an
  effective online service to you. These are known as &ldquo;First Party&rdquo; cookies.</p>

<p>We may also use cookies issued by third parties (&ldquo;Third Party&rdquo; cookies) to track the websites you visited or search terms you used immediately prior to visiting this site. This helps us improve our online profile.</p>

<p>We do not use cookies to store any personally identifiable information about you.</p>

  <strong>Our responsibility for website links</strong>
</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is limited to the personal information which we collect and use via this website. We do provide links within this site to other websites, including social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and sites operated by other
  brands within the dunkelkammer Group (e.g. Maris Kids, Zalkin Training and NexInotec.. ). If you follow these links, you should use these sites in conjunction with their applicable user and privacy policies as their data practices fall outside the scope
  of this Privacy Policy. Further, we can have no responsibility for or control over the information collected by any third party website and we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you may provide on such websites.</p>

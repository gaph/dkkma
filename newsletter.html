    <h3>E-mail marketing terms A through Z</h3>

    <p><strong>A/B split testing</strong>: A test in which a list is split into two parts and sent different creative, so that the sender can see which performs better.</p>

    <p><strong>Alt text</strong>: Text that appears in place of an image before its downloaded in the inbox. (This is the description when uploading an image in your account.)</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Soft bounce: An e-mail sent to an active e-mail address, but then is turned away before being delivered. Often, the problem is temporary -- the server is down or the recipients mailbox is full. The e-mail might be held at the recipients server to be delivered later, or the senders e-mail program may attempt to deliver it again.</li>
      <li>Hard bounce: An e-mail sent to an invalid, closed or nonexistent e-mail account (no connection is made to the recipients server).</li>
    </ol>

We often get this question: How much does a website costs? It's like buying a new car.

Usually, the more you're willing to spend, the more features, performance and comfort you get. Brands aside, there's a base model that will get you from A to B. However, if you want more comfort (leather seats, airconditon, extra quiet interior, seat heater..), more performance (faster engine, stronger breaks) or superior vendor support, you will need to pay more money. The same applies to web development.

Let's look at the key price influencing factors

1. How much content / how many pages will we be working on?
2. Do you want to migrate an existing website?
3. Can you provide quality content (Text as well as images)?
4. Does you company have a branding guideline?
5. Do you want to manage the content yourself? (CMS)
6. Do you want a responsive web design? (Adapt to screen size)
7. Is there going to be any blog or new section?
8. How many languages do you require?
9. Will there be any need for training aftwards?
10. Is there going to be a Shop sections (e-commerce)
11. Should we set-up any landing pages?
12. Do you require an integration with any 3rd party system? (Salesforce..)
13. Do you need SEO optimization?

Before we send out any proposal, we find out about our clients requirements and walk them trough the process. Once the expectations are clear, we will start working on a estimate. If we run into any budget constrains, we advice on the most important features. Here we could for example schedule to develop a blog or e-commerce section at a later date.

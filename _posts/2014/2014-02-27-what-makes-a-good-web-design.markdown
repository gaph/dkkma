If you plan to have your company website redone, it's often not only the design that bothers you but that you may be losing potential customers.

Here are the five top reasons why you may want to redesign your website:

- Website loads slow
- Design is outdated and unattractive
- Does not work on mobile devices
- Does not connect to your CRM
- No call to action

Let's dive in a little deeper and explore each of these points and what we can do about them.

## Website loads slow

A slow website could have a major impact on your revenue. Companies like Amazon lose millions if their website loads just milliseconds slower. Of course most of us aren't Amazon but unfortunately we see more severe issues the smaller the company. There is no ideal loading speed but we usually try to keep it below two seconds, no matter how heavy the site. Sure your users internet connection plays a role as well but most people have a fast enough connection to notice if you are lagging.

Another thing to note is, that Google also measures your site speed. In fact, it's part of your Google ranking. A fast site will naturally rank higher.

## Design is outdated and unattractive

The market place has become very competitive and almost every company has a website nowadays. Often consumers do not only compare based on price and services, they also look at the website - does it make a professional impression? Do I like what I see?

In Analytics we have something called 'Bounce Rate'. This number measures how many people visit your site and leave almost immediately. After all web developments and designs we've done for our clients, the bounce rate dropped significantly - once over 30%.



## Does not work in mobile devices

Usually around 20% of your visitors are on mobile devices. If you are unable to serve a mobile optimized page, these visitors will have a hard time navigating your site - certainly a bad impression.

At DKKMA we use a technique called 'Responsive Design'. We code your website in a way, that it automatically adapts to the device screen size. A desktop visitor will see the biggest version with all information, a tablet or mobile visitor will see a slightly re-arranged, less heavy version of the website. This has one huge advantage: We only need to maintain one website rather then previously up to three - desktop, tablet and phone.



## Does not connect to your CRM

The absolutely biggest waste of time is to manually enter lead information into your CRM. We can integrate most CRM solutions with your website so that if a client fills out a form, this information will automatically be entered into your CRM system. No contact details get lost! Some of the CRM's supported include (left to right) Salesforce Sales Cloud, Highrise, Close.io, Base CRM, Sugar CRM, Microsoft Dynamics. Many more are supported as well.

## No call to action

You have a website to sell a product but people will not necessarily buy if you do not ask them to. Studies have shown that easy to read call to action banner or even landing pages increase the conversion rate significantly. Since your client is already looking at your product, why not collect their info and ask them to buy?



## Tracking your site performance

After your new website has been completed and goes live, cooperation should not stop. Now it's important to measure the performance and tweak certain elements. Sometimes a different wording or arrangement of text can increase conversion rate significantly. Also important: See where your traffic is coming from. Make sure to track what works and what doesn't.

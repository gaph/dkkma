In reality however, you need to take a lot of factors into consideration to maximize the efficiency of your advertisement campaign. Today we're taking a closer look at how to optimize your Landing Page and make sure that you convert your visitors to leads.

- Your ad keywords need to correlate with the page content you send your leads to
- Ideally, you have a call to action and a conversion form (Capture visitor information)
- Do A/B testing. Sometimes a small change will increase conversion substantially
- If you're selling products, offer a 10% discount on the first purchase
- If you're selling services, offer freebies (enter e-mail, download PDF) or explain how your service is valuable
- Make it as easy as possible to get in touch with you (phone number, e-mail address)
- If you collect your visitors e-mail address, send an auto-response. Make sure to follow up within a day.
-  measure your ROI (Return of Investment - Money spend, new business won / sales made)

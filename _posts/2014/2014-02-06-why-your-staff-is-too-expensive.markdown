Cash is tight and business look for opportunities to save. However, employing staff to do marketing and design jobs for you, is often not the best solution.

"Every minute you spend of your own or staff time, is wasted time."

*Your own staff*

1. Cost to hire new staff
2. Time to find someone capable for a certain task
3. Limited set of skills
4. Employment contracts
5. Social security payments
6. Possible sick days and nobody to fill in

Even if you find someone capable, he is not going to be able to cover all areas. You would have to hire a second, third or forth person to really fulfill your marketing and design needs and deliver the work in a timely manner. An agency however has staff to cover all areas plus we hold regular meetings to discuss work internally and gather feedback on how to improve the quality of the output.

"Do what you are best at: Developing and selling great products and services"

*Agency*

1. Pricing is usually agreed on in advance
2. Large number of brilliant people and skills
3. Years of experience
4. No long term contacts
5. Staff to fill in, in case someone gets sick

If your agency doesn't do a good job, you can easily find someone new. However, if your staff is not performing as expected, you are going to spend more money and time to find someone else. For us, our name is on the line, the staff doesn't necessarily care.

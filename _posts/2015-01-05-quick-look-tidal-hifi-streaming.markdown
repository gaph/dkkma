In October 2014, the Scandinavian music streaming service Tidal launched in the UK and US with a library of over 25 million tracks in 16-bit/44.1 FLAC quality. Unlike Spotify, Tidal does not offer any free streaming (with adverts) but costs £19.99/month.

> “The music is just one part of the service. The expert editorial educates, entertains and enriches the music experience while the music videos complement the music perfectly”

_- Tidal’s chief executive Andy Chen._

**Streaming**

- AAC 96, Standard
- AAC 320, High
- FLAC 1411 16-bit/44.1, HiFi

**What we like**

- Tidal claims that there are over 25 million tracks
- Playback is fast, usually without any noticeable buffering
- Save music for offline playback on both iPhone & Android
- Useful curated content

Tidal is also available on Android as well as Mac and Windows.

**What we don’t like**

- The Mac application is disappointing
- HiFi playback is only supported in Google Chrome, the Desktop application, the iPhone and a number of Android devices.
- Tidal costs £19.99/month ($19.99 in the US).

We at DKKMA are ExpressionEngine fanatics. We absolutely love the way this CMS works and so do our clients. However, one things get's overlooked easily - just how powerful ExpressionEngine is.

Whether you're a startup or an enterprise, ExpressionEngine is capable of handling more then your website. Let me list a few things we do and have done with ExpressionEngine:

- CMS (Content Management System) obviously!
- e-mail Marketing System
- Help Desk Software
- Control Panel to manage subscriptions
- Library Management (Books, DVD's..)
- Forum for discussion
- Blog / News sites
- Video publishing (Some sort of YouTube)
- CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
- ...

Why should you care? It doesn't actually matter whether you're just getting started or have been in business for a few years. We often find ourselves needing new software to accomplish a certain task. May it be handling support tickets, sending out e-mail newsletters or simply taking care of the website (CMS). Now, each tools comes with it's own price tag and a monthly subscription so being able to put everything under one roof (ExpressionEngine / Your website) Is a huge time and money saver.

Just recently we have heard of a campaign called 'Made in creative UK'. We were so moved by their aim, we decided to contribute - you should too! Many people, even those from the UK, are not even aware how many fantastic products are made here. To help raise awareness, we encourage any UK company to have a look at the campaigns website.

### Their Aim

"UK creative industries are behind some of the best-selling and highest grossing products and franchises in the world, but this success unfortunately does not equate with public awareness that there are UK companies behind them." - Quote by Made in creative UK

### Strong Support

The campaign is supported by both industry as well as governmental institutions.

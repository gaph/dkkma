As of June 2013 LinkedIn counts 259 million professional users. That's 259 million potential leads! Now, if we are realistic about this, only a fraction of these users will be of interest for your business. A company page helps you target and engage with them.

How do you benefit from a company page?

- Share stories about your company
- Introduce and link to your products
- Engage with the people that follow your company
- Post details about an opening in your company

### Contact details

It's important to update your company page regularly. If any of your employees use LinkedIn, ask them to associate with your company page and share content you post with their own followers. This will increase your reach substantially.

It's easy to add a new company page to your profile:

1. Move your cursor over Interests at the top of your homepage and select Companies.
2. Click the Create link in the Create a Company Page box on the right side of the page.

DKKMA is a agency based in London, UK, which primarily develops applications written in PHP. Our preferred platform is ExpressionEngine which we have over 6 years of experience with.

There are a number of reasons why weâ€™ve chosen ExpressionEngine:

- Professional, Dedicated Support
- Incredible Flexibility
- Stability and Security
- Performance
- Ease of Use
- We chose the best platform for any given usage case but usually we'll end up with ExpressionEngine.

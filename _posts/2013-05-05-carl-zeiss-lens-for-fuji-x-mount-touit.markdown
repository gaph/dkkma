Carl Zeiss just released detailed technical specification of the new Zeiss Lens for the Fuji X Mount (Fuji X-Pro1, Fuji X-E1). While an exact release date is not set yet, we expect them to be available in June 2013. Since there's a lot of information scattered all over the Internet, we're going to do our best to collect them here.

The Zeiss lens is now available for pre-order. Shipping June 2013.

### Specification

We were very exited to hear that Zeiss is going to release an autofocus lens for the X-Mount. Since we have been using the Fuji X-E1 with Zeiss ZM lenses (Leica M Mount) for quite some time, we are satisfied with the performance of both camera and glass but were never quite happy with the manual focus on the Fuji.

[Touit 1.8/32 MFT Curve][18 MFT]

### Aperture Blades
"The Touit lenses feature a nine-blade iris that closes to create an almost perfectly circular aperture."

### Material
Here's what the Carl Zeiss team has to say about the built quality and material:

> "The mirrorless system cameras are lighter and more compact than SLR cameras. With our new lenses for this camera system we are continue the development of our high quality lens concept while simultaneously aiming at a relatively light-weight design. For the mechanical components we looked for the best compromise between the quality of the material and the product's total weight. For this reason, we decided to use a combination of materials. For parts that do not require metal for accuracy, solidity or durability, we have incorporated lighter materials such as plastic." - Source

### Comparison
A retailer in brussels had the chance to test-drive the lens. You can find the images on his Facebook

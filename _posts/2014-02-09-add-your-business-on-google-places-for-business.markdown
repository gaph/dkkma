A quick, efficient and free way to be found on Google Search is to list your business in Google's 'Places for Business'. You can enter details such as phone number, website, products sold and the type of payment you accept. Once someone searches for your business, Google will display your business on a map and offer additional details.

In the example below, we are looking for a bakery in London. Google returns with a map and businesses related to the search term. Hovering over one of the results will reveal additional details such as price range, rating as well as opening hours. Obviously this works best, the more specific the search term. It also helps to be in a less crowded area. Either way, adding your business to Places for Business definitely helps to be found.

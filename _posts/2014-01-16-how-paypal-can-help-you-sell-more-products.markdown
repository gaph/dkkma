If you are running a small, local store, your reach may be limited. Even though the products you sell are great, there are only that many people living in the area. You may have already thought about some sort of e-commerce solution or putting some stuff on eBay or Amazon but it's usually quite a hassle - especially if budgets are limited or you are just getting started.

There's a solution: Your own website, featuring your products, with integrated order form. So what happens is simple: Your customer can visit your website, have a look at your products and order them online - without login with direct payment. Once an order has been placed, your customer will receive an order confirmation and receipt from PayPal. You on the other hand will receive an Email with payment confirmation and address details. Now you'll just need to pack the items and send them out.

### Things to take note of:

- PayPal charges you 2.9% + USD 0.30 per transaction
- Depending on the country, customers may pay via Credit Card, Bank Transfer or PayPal balance
- Once the money arrives in you PayPal account, you can withdraw it immediately
- Your customers do not need to have a PayPal account to make a payment

This solution is ideal if you're looking to sell between 1 and 10 different products

### Ideas / Suggestions:

- Pizza Restaurant: Offering online order for customers within a certain area (You can even offer coupons!)
- Flower Shop: Have them choose the flowers they want, when they want and pay online right away
- Cosmetic products: Sell your creams, lotions and lipsticks to a huge audience!
- Custom made hats: Ask them to pick their size and favorite design and off they go - worldwide.

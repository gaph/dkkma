In a survey published in 2013, 73% of Retail / Wholesale / Consumer Goods companies responded that they have acquired a customer using a lead from Facebook. On the other hand, in the Banking / Insurance / Financial industry, the rate was much lower with only 33% of respondents saying that they acquired a customer trough Facebook.

Itâ€™s also interesting to note that it depends on whom you are dealing with. B2C companies, not surprisingly, have the highest success rate on Facebook. Companies dealing B2B report a slightly higher success rate on LinkedIn (Professional Network).

While these charts are a great reference, we always recommend our clients to explore different options. The majority of businesses may do very well on Facebook, others might be able to find a niche market on Pinterest or Google+. Facebook often attracts by size alone - while most of your customers already have a Facebook account, only a fraction are on Pinterest or Google+.

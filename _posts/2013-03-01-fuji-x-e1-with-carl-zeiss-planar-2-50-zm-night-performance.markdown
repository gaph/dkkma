excerpt: "We’ve recently picked up a Carl Zeiss Planar 2/50 ZM (75 equivalent on the X-E1 crop sensor). It’s a solid lens, which performs especially well for portrait photography. Since we haven’t come across many images shot with this lens on a X-E1, we decided to post a few to show how it performs at night."

We’ve recently picked up a Carl Zeiss Planar 2/50 ZM (75 equivalent on the X-E1 crop sensor). It’s a solid lens, which performs especially well for portrait photography. Since we haven’t come across many images shot with this lens on a X-E1, we decided to post a few to show how it performs at night.

Finally, hands-on: I’ve been waiting for the Zeiss Touit to arrive for quite some time. It’s the first real alternative to the Fuji Lens series on the X-E1 and X-1Pro. However, now that I hold it in my hands, I’m not as excited anymore.

Let me explain: I’ve been using the Zeiss ZM lens series for quite some time. While you’ve got to get used to manual focus, the Lens feels amazingly well built (similarly good as a Leica lens) and you’re 100% in control.

### Zeiss ZM Planar 50mm f2.0

- The aperture ring has a very satisfying, mechanical click.
- Manual focus is smooth and quick once you have some practice.
- The Zeiss ZM works with almost any Leica M ever made and will happily sit on another camera with the correct adapter. Fuji even offers an official Leica M adapter.
- It’s all metal. It feels very solid and well built.

Of course you will need to accept some limitations.

1. Focusing in low light is quite a challenge: While a rangefinder camera such as the Leica M won't have any trouble, the Fuji viewfinder becomes almost unusable.
2. The Zeiss ZM does not communicate with the camera. You will need to add the desired EXIF data manually.

### Zeiss Touit 1.8/32

- It’s an autofocus lens
- There’s no ‘true’ manual focus. As you turn the focus ring, the camera will make the adjustment.
- The Focus speed is not terrific but quick enough for most shots.

The Zeiss Touit is certainly a good lens and many amateurs and professional photographers will enjoy it.

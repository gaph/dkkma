Part of our service is to invite clients during early development. While we piece together the website, they are able to follow the process and provide feedback at any stage. Even though the design and scope of work has been agreed on in advance, small changes such as a different picture or wording are still taken into consideration.

In the past, this process has been tedious for both clients and our team.

- To report a bug or give feedback, our client would capture a screenshot and make notes. The screenshot would end up in our account executive e-mail account and he or she would forward it to our development team. The development team would then create an 'issue' and work on the adjustments.
- Alternatively our client would discuss the changes during a phone call. Our account executive or designer would then forward the notes to our development team - Still not ideal.

### Meet BugHerd

This little tool was about to revolutionize the way we work with clients. As soon as we invite our clients into the development process, they are able to give feedback - right on the website. It's as easy as clicking on an image and saying "Please use ...". This comment goes straight to our development team and within moments we are able to make the necessary adjustments.

- Makes it easy for our clients to give feedback
- Cuts down on time wasted during development (saves money, quick results)
- No feedback gets lost.
- It goes without saying that we still pick up the phone to discuss progress and overall design.

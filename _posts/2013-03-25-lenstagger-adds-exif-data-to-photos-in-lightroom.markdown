excerpt: "Many of us know this problem: If you’re shooting with an old lens, it likely does not have any electronic contacts. Aside from some other things, these help the camera recognize the attached lens and with every frame you take, this info is written into the EXIF data of either JPEG or RAW file. Adding this data manually is both time consuming and adds extra steps."

Many of us know this problem: If you’re shooting with an old lens, it likely does not have any electronic contacts. Aside from some other things, these help the camera recognize the attached lens and with every frame you take, this info is written into the EXIF data of either JPEG or RAW file. Adding this data manually is both time consuming and adds extra steps.

Luckily we’ve recently found a cool Lightroom plugin called LensTagger. Upon first launch, it will ask you to enter some details about your lens (Manufacturer, Focal Length, Aperture…). Once you’re done, it’s easy to apply the data to any number of images right inside of Lightroom.

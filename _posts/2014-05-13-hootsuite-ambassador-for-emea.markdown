We are delighted to announce that one of our team member has recently been appointed as a HootSuite Ambassador for the EMEA region.

HootSuite has played an important role in our own social media strategy, combining the most important 3 - Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn - under one roof. While we manage many of our clients social media accounts trough this platform, others have adopted it them self. It's a great tool to schedule posts, keep an eye on multiple streams at once and output powerful analytic reports.

If you're interested to find out more about HootSuite, do feel free to [get in touch][contact] with us. We can hook you up on an extended, free trial.

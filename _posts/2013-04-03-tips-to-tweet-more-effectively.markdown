Twitter is one of the most popular social media networks in the world. It’s easy and free to get started and if you follow our tips, it will be rewarding too.

### Tools

While it’s easy enough to install Twitter on your mobile phone and desktop, the native client is often not the ideal choice when it comes to managing your Twitter account.

One of our favorite tools to handle our Facebook and Twitter accounts is Hootsuite.. It allows you to monitor your timeline and conversations, schedules messages and keeps track of every link with built in analytics. This makes it easy to determine your most popular content and cater to your audience.

### Patience

If you’re just getting started with social media, you probably don’t have too many followers. Kindly ask existing customers, friends and relatives to follow you on Twitter. Make sure that you also place links on your website and e-mail signature.

### Rewards

Whether you’re a local business or an international cooperation, make it rewarding to follow your company. Try to engage users and make sure that you respond to queries. It also helps to offer little gifts or vouchers. If you’re a coffee shop, offer a 10% discount for the day. If people like your coffee and cake, the message will surely spread.

### Be who you are

Show a little bit personality. Snap a picture once in a while and don’t simply repost what others have to say. People will follow you because they either like what you do or have similar interests.

### Don’t overdo it

If you’re using social media effectively, you’ll be able to attract new clients and connect to existing ones to get feedback on your products and services. However, don’t spend too much time on it.

We’ve all been told about the importance of having great content, but before you start writing one article after another, define your target audience. **Who are you actually selling to**?

## Your Buyer Personas

> A buyer persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on market research and real data about your existing customers.”
- [HubSpot][HubSpotQuote]

The thing is, if you don’t know whom you’re selling to, you’re not only wasting your time but the time of those you approach. Think about it: If you’re the VP of Marketing, you don’t necessarily care about accounting software or automating server deployments (What?).

On the other hand, if you have a clearly defined buyer persona, you can approach the right prospects (segmentation) at the right time, to help them solve their pain points.

### Why You Need Buyer Personas

Having a well-defined buyer persona will help you achieve a number of things

- Higher conversion rates
- Higher margins (You know exactly what they want and how to give it to them)
- Clearly map out the individual lifecycle stages

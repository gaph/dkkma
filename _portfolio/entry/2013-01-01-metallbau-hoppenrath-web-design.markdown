Metallbau Hoppenrath has been a family run company since 1948. Recognizing that the Internet plays a more important role then ever, the company first approached us in 2007 to have their first website designed and set-up. The site has been a great success - enabling clients to view previous projects and get a better idea about the quality of work. In 2013, the company decided to have the website redone once again. One of the main goals was to make content more accessible - both to mobile and desktop devices. The result is an easy to navigate, SEO optimized page that works on any screen size.

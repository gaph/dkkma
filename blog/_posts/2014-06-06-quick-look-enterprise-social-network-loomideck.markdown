There are many tools that promise to make our life easier. However, over the years, many of these tools become bloated as vendors are adding new features and integration.

Startup to rescue: Start from scratch and build something even better.

- Build using the latest technology (more responsive)
- Often easier to learn and use (less clutter)
- Up to date Integration & Mobile applications
- Usually at least somehow innovative / trying to solve a problem
- Meets specific needs
- Today we would like to have a quick look at Loomideck.

> With Loomideck you will aggregate interesting and valuable enterprise team content, be in touch with what is relevant to you and your colleagues, discuss things in virtual meeting rooms, assign tasks and evaluate your team's knowledge. Loomideck is currently in BETA.

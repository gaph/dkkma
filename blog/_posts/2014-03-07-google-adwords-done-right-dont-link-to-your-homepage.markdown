Whether you are just getting started with Google AdWords or have been running your campaign for some time - There is one thing many companies get wrong: They link to their homepage.

**The problem**: You may be seeing some results but I assure you, you are wasting money on prospects that get lost or do not have the time to look trough your website. This may not be an issue for a small business with only 2-3 services that are listed right on the front page but the more complex your site, the more likely you are losing people on the way.

Since you are likely paying for every click, it's important to make sure that the person clicking, immoderately finds what he or she is looking for.

**The solution**: Rather then sending prospects to your homepage, send them to the product or service that directly correlates with your ad. If you want to further improve your conversion, add contact details / a contact form on the same page. That way you make sure, if they are interested, it's easy for them to get in touch.

Salesforce does a great job landing page design. It reassures you that you've made the right decision "trusted CRM choice of...", goes trough the most important features and presents you with 3 pricing options at the bottom of the page. By the time you get there, you're likely ready to start your trial.

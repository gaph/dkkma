This post is sequel to our original 'How much does a web development cost?' We also recommend you to check out What makes a good web design?

As web design agency we have completed many projects over the years. Starting with small shops and one-page sites, up to complex CMS based websites for large cooperation. Today we take a quick look at what different types of websites cost.

Let's jump right in:

### Basic Website

The price for a basic website varies between 800€ and 1600€. We have seen much higher then that but we would not recommend paying any less since you are going to have to sacrifice on quality.

This type of website is popular as a sort of online brochure. It's basically a 24 hours salesperson that guides your customer trough the products and services you offer. Comparing the basic website to a custom website, it's usually much more lightweight and includes not as many pages.

_Best for Small shops with limited number of products and services._

### Custom Website

A custom website costs between 1800€ and 5500€. At this spending level your website is tailored to meet your specific market needs. You can expect a certain 'wow-factor'.

Comparing it to the Basic Website, the pricing is calculated at the same rate. The website takes much more time to build and usually includes SEO optimization to rank higher on Google, Yahoo and Bing.

### Content Management System (CMS)

A website designed and build with full CMS integration (ExpressionEngine CMS) will typically cost you between 2400€ and 6400€. The final amount depends on your specific needs and the extend of customization required.

These websites are build with both, functionality and appearance in mind. Custom art design, top notch images and a lot of dynamic content is the base for this type of website. You will be able to manage and update most of your content trough the installed CMS.

_This is the most popular type of website among our clients. The CMS makes it easy for clients to modify their website. We usually include a handbook and, if required, a 1-1 training to get started. This is also the most future proof type of website - the CMS allows us to make site wide changes and add a almost limitless number of additional pages._

### The Enterprise Website

A highly complex website with extensive social network integration and advance blogging and web development will quickly raise the price tag. This type of website runs between 12000€ to 75000€+

These websites are not more beautiful or easier to find on Google, these website usually contain custom code for a very specific use case or many thousand pages

We highly recommend to hire a professional development team to design and develop your website. The initial cost may seem high but the ROI always outweighs the initially expenditure. Why not get in touch with us and take advantage of our free, initial consulting?

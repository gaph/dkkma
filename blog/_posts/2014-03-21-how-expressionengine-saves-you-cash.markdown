We at DKKMA are ExpressionEngine fanatics. We absolutely love the way this CMS works and so do our clients. However, one things get's overlooked easily - just how powerful ExpressionEngine is.

Whether you're a startup or an enterprise, ExpressionEngine is capable of handling more then your website. Let me list a few things we do and have done with ExpressionEngine:

- CMS (Content Management System) obviously!
- Email Marketing System
- Help Desk Software
- Control Panel to manage subscriptions
- Library Management (Books, DVD's..)
- Forum for discussion
- Blog / News sites
- Video publishing (Some sort of YouTube)
- CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
- ...

Why should you care? It doesn't actually matter whether you're just getting started or have been in business for a few years. We often find ourselves needing new software to accomplish a certain task. May it be handling support tickets, sending out email newsletters or simply taking care of the website (CMS). Now, each tools comes with it's own price tag and a monthly subscription so being able to put everything under one roof (ExpressionEngine / Your website) Is a huge time and money saver.

**Now comes the exciting part: User Management**

ExpressionEngine comes with a powerful set of user management tools. You can keep track of all your clients and customers right in ExpressionEngine and assign custom permissions to each user or user group. That means, the marketing guy is able to edit the website and send new email newsletters while the blogging guy can only update the blog / news section. Your clients on the other hand have only access to their control panel and account info. As if this is not enough, you will be able to send custom email newsletters to individual groups.
